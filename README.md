# Via Mallorca

An app to track buses all over Mallorca, check schedules, routes, and much more!

**This app is not affiliated with the government or the respective companies.**

## Motivation behind this project

**[@YarosMallorca's](https://github.com/YarosMallorca) take:**
I have noticed that Mallorca's public transport system lacks good digital integration, it is complicated to get accurate up-to-date information on the buses, their live location, and such. This information is public but obstructed by unintuitive user interfaces, partially broken web pages, and non-existent or obsolete mobile apps.

This motivated me to start this project, **Via Mallorca**, to help people (locals and travelers alike) use public transport efficiently on this island.
