#### What won't be accepted
A word about the anti-tourism topic: 
The original maintainers **do not** condone any anti-tourism movement in the Balearic Islands, as such, issues/pull requests regarding the topic will be **closed immediately** and **not merged into production**.
We will not support this kind of behavior. Our app is for everyone to enjoy - locals and travellers alike!

We also do not support any russian translations/references. Stand with Ukraine! 🇺🇦

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information, and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions.
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/open-transport-mallorca/ViaMallorca/issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Collect information about the bug:
- OS, Platform and Version
- Possibly your input and the output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue?
